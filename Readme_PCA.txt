PCA on Digits Dataset
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the "Digits" dataset from sklearn. The "Digits" dataset contains images of handwritten digits, each represented as an 8x8 pixel grid, making it a great dataset for experimenting with dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. By using PCA, we reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, enabling efficient visualization and understanding of the most important features of the images.

Dataset Overview
The "Digits" dataset is a collection of 8x8 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and includes:
•	Features: 64 features (one for each pixel) representing grayscale values of each 8x8 image.
•	Classes: 10 classes, representing digits from 0 to 9.
•	Samples: 1,797 samples in total.

Project Goals
1.	Dimensionality Reduction: Use PCA to reduce the dataset from 64 features to fewer components while retaining the majority of information.
2.	Visualization: Visualize the reduced components in 2D or 3D space, allowing us to observe how PCA separates the digits.
3.	Data Compression: Analyze how well the reduced components reconstruct the original images, exploring trade-offs between compression and information retention.

Approach
1.	Load the Dataset: Import the "Digits" dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_digits.
2.	Apply PCA: Use PCA to reduce the dataset dimensions, aiming to retain at least 95% of the variance.
3.	Visualization: Plot the digits in a 2D or 3D space based on the principal components, which helps visualize clusters and separation between digit classes.
4.	Reconstruction: Reconstruct the digits from the reduced components to assess the quality of information retained at lower dimensions.

Use Cases
This project demonstrates key applications of PCA:
•	Feature Reduction: Reducing the number of features required for image data, making it easier to work with in machine learning models.
•	Data Visualization: Plotting high-dimensional data in lower dimensions for exploratory data analysis.
•	Noise Reduction: Removing less significant components, which often contain noise, to improve data quality for modeling.

Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	numpy
•	matplotlib
•	sklearn
